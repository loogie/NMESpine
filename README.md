Haxe NME Spine API

SPINE by Esoteric Software

Spine is a 2D Skeletal animation program much like the skeletal animation build in to Flash, the difference being Spine is Spine plans to support most language, and exports to JSON to allow for use in not supported languages.

This is a VERY early version of a Haxe NME parser for the Spine 2D Skeletion Animator.

Currently I am working on...

* Skeleton json parsing and class framework
* Animation json parsing and class framework
* Asset management, importing and handling images used in animations
* Preforming animations using Actuate
